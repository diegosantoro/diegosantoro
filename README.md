### Hi there :earth_americas:

I got a Ph.D. in Information Engineering - Computer Engineering at the [Department of Information Engineering](https://phd.dei.unipd.it) of the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/).
My research focuses on the development of novel and efficient Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Algorithms with rigorous theoretical guarantees on their quality, leveraging on Statistical Learning Theory and Sampling Techniques. My research is often motivated by Molecular Biology Applications.
