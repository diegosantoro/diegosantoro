### Hi there :earth_americas:

:raising_hand: :wave:  
I am a second year Ph.D. student in Information Engineering at the [Department of Information Engineering](https://phd.dei.unipd.it) of the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/en/). I am a member of [VandinLab](https://www.dei.unipd.it/~vandinfa/), led by my Ph.D. supervisor Prof. Fabio Vandin.
My research focuses on the development of novel and efficient Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery Algorithms with rigorous theoretical guarantees on their quality, leveraging on Statistical Learning Theory and Sampling Techniques. My research is often motivated by Molecular Biology Applications.
